  # Values for Friedewald

  # Total cholesterol levels less than 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) are
  # considered desirable for adults. A reading between 200 and 239 mg/dL is
  # considered borderline high and a reading of 240 mg/dL and above is
  # considered high

  # Typically, doctors recommend an HDL level of 60 milligrams per deciliter
  # (mg/dL) of blood or higher. HDL that falls within the range of 40 to 59
  # mg/dL is normal, but could be higher. Having HDL under 40 mg/dL increases
  # your risk of developing heart disease.
